<p>“Never Run Back to the things That broke you” She said.<br>

So I picked up whats left, walked towards her-<br>

What’s there to break anyway?<br>

I suppose we hold our traumas the way the sky held the sun in the middle of the night.<br>

I never wanted to write this poem,<br>

I never could.<br>

Because God didn’t bless me the courage for shotguns,<br>

Because rope around my neck means head above water,<br>

and god, I am terrified of drowning.<br>

Dear knife, I am sorry for the triggers I’ve turned you into but you’re too blunt<br>

Dear razorblades, My skin feels different now<br>

Dear pills, Stop screaming. You are not as tempting as you could’ve been<br>

Dear height, I am not afraid of falling. But I still want to feel compact,<br>

She asked me why I’m running towards her “Never run back to the things that broke you” she said<br>

“What’s there to break anyway?” I replied<br>

She speak as if she’s begging for answers<br>

but I’m the one who needs them.<br>

“We are gone” she said<br>

And Now fast approaching cars screams opportunity for my body to test if it feels something,<br>

I close my eyes to resist.<br>

It’s just unfair how the people who loved less get’s to leave with fewer scars.<br>

How she became the product of metamorphosis<br>

And I just a part of that process,<br>

I have no idea how to put makeup to the dead<br>

I have no idea how to unerase.<br>

So I stayed. Watch her turn her back.<br>

People keep telling me to remember the good, the laughter, the whole world we built,<br>

how we used to go to shopping malls picking up furniture,<br>

I<br>

I love my life with her,<br>

but I cant bring her to say the same<br>

She is a war I survived<br>

But still cant forget.<br>

…<br>

“Never run back to the things that broke you” she said<br>

But this body involuntarily chased.<br>

She ran as fast as she could.<br>

This body want to chase,<br>

but then I remember how she used to tie strings to connect her hand to mine,<br>

and how often she tugs it to make sure I’m still there<br>

Following.<br>

That was love,<br>

as simple as that.<br>

Sometimes,<br> </p>
	 
	 <h3>Another one of "those" kind of poem</h3>

	<h3> I never realized the tension when both of your eyes locked.<br>

So I guess I’m the only practical joke in this entire situation<br>

1- The first time I saw you and her in a picture, I want to take my entire arm. Shove it inside your throat and snatch the happiness right off of your face.<br>

2- If I will have the opportunity I will probably punch you in the face.<br>

3- I apologize in advance. And I know it makes no sense to have this much anger to a guy I never knew. But my definition of love is being robbed at an alley 3 times  a row and hoping that the 4th wont be the same. But it is.<br>

There is nothing logical about cutting the most important parts of yourself and put it in the hands that shake, that tremble.<br>

4- I guess there is no rational thing about love. She stutters even she claims to be fluent in english, She can eat like there’s no tomorrow but she doesn’t know how to mix her pancit canton, Love sings but sometimes love get’s nervous, but she fights. She fights.<br>

5- Rudy is right “Cupid is irresponsible” and I am tired of him using me as target practice.<br>

6- People say remember the good the laughter—- Hell. That’s what I’m trying to forget. I am trying to forget. But the hands of my clock doesn’t seem to know where they are going.<br>

7- She always wore her heart like a warcry, No wonder you sound so familiar.<br>

8- I think I’ve seen you somewhere in her smile, heard you in her laughter, the way she opens the windows or goes out for you to see her.<br>

9- I have this Box containing all her happy, most of them still shines.<br>

I guess this belongs to you too.<br></h3>

<p>Dear you,<br>

I never knew why rainbow colors are ordered that way,<br>

But believe me when I say,<br>

That i would break all protocols of the spectrum to get to you,<br>

you,<br>

You are poop, the kind that i will want to hold on to-<br>

until i reach the urinal,<br>

you,<br>

like poop, the hint of guilty you feel when you wipe it of, after holding for so long<br>

You are porkchop. I know this doesn’t make any sense<br>

but I love porkchops.<br>

And you are porkchop.<br>

you,<br>

but you are also like fish,<br>

and like fish, you pretend to be boneless<br>

but you aren’t<br>

you pretentious bitch<br>

but hey<br>

Porkchop.<br>

you,<br>

but you can also be like a grenade<br>

something so explosive yet contained<br>

you,<br>

like the words I tried to describe you about<br>

you are peanut butter and jelly sandwich<br>

something that doesn’t make any sense but somehow managed to be beautiful<br>

you,<br>

Even though you make no sense at all.<br>

Even though Irrationality is your bestfriend<br>

and change is your worst enemy,<br>

but somehow your only company<br>

You are something<br>

you are worth something<br>

And I cant help but adore it.</p><br>

		<h3>Another Desperate Prose begging to sound Happy"</h3>

	
		<p>We are not obligated to want each other forever. When I ask you to be with me, I’m not pulling you into a promise you’re not ready to make, I’m just asking you to be with me. Be here. Take up space. Don’t let time swallow empty seconds– make this worthwhile. It’s foolish to believe that every person you cave for is meant to stay. But that doesn’t make wanting them any less important. Maybe we’re not meant to be, maybe a lifetime is too long, maybe we’ll only last during the calm before the storm. And that’s okay. If life was an exchange of hearts, I’d gladly take yours for a while. It is worth it to know that there was at least a time when we were enough for each other.</p>
		
		<h3>Unravel me</h3>
		<p>Sometimes I wish people could read minds. Maybe not direct thoughts, but pick up an aura or two, a distracting emotion, a fleeting feeling, a breakdown bubbling on the surface. It would make it a lot easier to say I don’t want to be anything today. Everyone kind of just looks at you and expects you to be alright all the time. I’m not saying that’s wrong– I mean I guess the default is supposed to be ‘okay.’ But when I am two nights going without sleep, four days deep wondering if grandpa will make it to the next morning, six months lingering on why I don’t treat myself as well as I did a year ago– I just don’t want to exist. I know it sounds bad, but I just can’t deal with easy banter and laughter that sounds as genuine as it feels. I can’t take the slight provocations, the snide comments, the sarcasm that suddenly feels like a knife fixed in between my ribcage. It’s weak of me, sure, but everyone needs a break sometimes, and it’s not broken of me to ask for a moment of solitude. To grieve, to breathe, to acknowledge that hurt is real, to deal, to cry, to let my feelings run free without shame. Sometimes I wish people could read minds. Maybe then I could bleed without leaving any stains. Maybe then I wouldn’t have to hide the parts of me that are trying to get better.</p>
		
		<h3> Dont tell love your idea of a happy ending</h3>
	<p>Don’t write your lover into a poem. Immortalization is for a love that does not move. Grow with your partner. Untangle your limbs from the fights. Find new things about them that you want to write about. Let them leave. Let them return. Open door, close door, they are not the only story that has to be beautiful. Let it bloom or let it fester, never an in between state of caricature. Words will never do justice to your love and your lover. Be with them.</p>

		<h3> Dear Grim Reaper</h3>
		<h2> A special Section written for someone<h2>
	  </section>
	  <h3>For the Grim Reaper</h3>
	  <p>You make me want to be better.<br>

I don’t know what that means all the time<br>

But when I get cold I don’t reach for the lighter anymore.<br>

That’s not saying that you exist to fix me<br>

Because I exist to fix myself and I’m glad to<br>

Because people like you are concrete<br>

And this isn’t the world I thought it was.<br>

It’s like getting beat down constantly<br>

Until one day you discover that you could stand<br>

And all of a sudden gravity means a totally different thing-<br>

I’m not trying to make it sound like you are my universe<br>

Because you aren’t,<br>

You are just<br>

Concrete<br>

I don’t wake up waiting for the night to call me to bed anymore<br>

I stay up late hoping the stars would talk instead of flashing morse codes<br>

When the city gets too loud I don’t get lost wishing that a car would<br>

find itself inches from hitting me<br>

I just wonder where this train<br>

Is taking me<br>

Im not saying love fixes anything<br>

Because it wont<br>

Glass will still break even when you paint<br>

Something beautiful on it<br>

But sometimes everything feels more bearable<br>

Around you<br>

Because for once there is someone else<br>

And happiness doesn’t seem<br>

Like it has to be a solitary journey<br>

Anymore.<br>


PS: I’m not saying this “fluttering” feeling is the cure, but it definitely helps…<br>

Ellipses are your thing mine is the word “and” both begs for a continuation. THAT IS TELLING.<br></p>
	
	<h3> Hey Grim Reaper</h3>
<p>Hey, If there’s one thing you taught me that really sticks it’s that “Sometimes you don’t have to understand it or know it. It’s there, you just have to feel it”. Although I am certain you are not able to remember this because of your self-proclaimed short term memory loss or my paraphrasing was just too good.<br>

Hey, how are you? I know everything was very sudden and all over the place. But believe me, I want to do those things. It’s tiring yet, I am smiling. It’s something I don’t understand but it’s something I want.<br>

Hey, your name is weird but you dressed it up in good clothes and took it dancing. That’s the only metaphor in this blog. Promise. Your name is weird, and contradicts with your way of enunciating things. How after 3-7 words the next word will have a longer stress than usual but with your name. Firm.<br>

Hey, I’m starting to like you.<br>

Hey, I don’t know why but don’t get me wrong I’m not doing this to lift me up. I’m doing this to smile even after falling. I’m sorry, another metphor. Maybe this will last for only a night? two nights? three? a week? a year? I dont know. But one thing is for sure. It’s helping.<br>

Hey, I like the way you interact with me, you trying not to and when you wont. You listen. I do too. This is not a competition about who listens better. But if it is, I’ll be the winner. See, you make me want to be better.<br>

Hey, I find you interesting. I don’t IDOLIZE you. I just like the way you handle things and when you do it your way. How everything is simple like your quiet addictions of rubbing your right foot with your left foot. How you often hang them on the chair. How Arts and crafts are always sophisticated when they walk pass you.<br>

Hey, Im Feeding your Conceited self at the same time giving you this vibes of Disgust. This prose or poem or something is not going anywhere.<br>

Hey, I’m sorry if this is very uncomfortable or if it’s too much to understand. But please just let me be. If I get out of hand or if I go a little too overboard. Do things that you do best. Being Concrete. Im sorry again for any nuisance I have caused. This is something I dont get to understand or have sorted out yet. But this is something I want to feel. So please. Let me.<br></p>

<h3> Remnants of happy that wants to be itself again, Grim Reaper. </h3>
	<p>She Narrates her world in third person. She sees it in third person rather. She devoted her life in making choices she will never regret. It’s a conceited claim to never regret things but “Why make it then?, if you’ll just regret” she often says. It’s unusual to find someone as concrete as this, as her. Making bold claims as if she can do it, She does it anyway.<br>

But notice/ Strong people are the ones who love to hide. Like how they show you the shore even they have the whole beach on their hands/ Like how the titanic was just a bluff. Body built to conquer oceans destroyed by something that just melts. Not romantic nor melodramatic. Comedic perhaps. Male Lead? Pathetic. Very ironic how he seemed pretty thirsty when he is on the verge of drowning. Female Lead? You can do better than that. Being painted beautiful is not the only way of getting attention/ Like how she rests her hands on the opposite sides of her arms, pressed back towards her chest, she is relaxing but still managed to look sophisticated. How she used the brush to stroke colors and paint all my chameleons clear. Her pen to draw a /triangle/ around me just to set a reminder that there must be- Distance. I laugh. She is strong and delicate.<br>

“Go back to your triangle” she said “Make me a new one. This time make it bigger” I replied. Here’s for hoping She’ll place it closer to what seemed like something she’ll never let me understand. This cycle continued until I took most of her space. She does not want this. So she made me an Island big enough for myself but she crafted me a boat too. But still unable to sail her seas. Because she does not want me to. She does not need me to. Given by the circumstances, I learned how to love the island, Watching the sun rises and sets, Being in awe to how the night sky patiently waits for its turn to perform even when most of the people are sleeping. She knows this. I smiled. laughed at the thought of maybe She’ll go tired of the seas and go back to this island. But she wont. Because she does not need to. So I picked up what’s left, walked towards the boat, Looked at her direction, and sailed backwards. Because why not? Going towards her is not the only way of getting to her. The world is not flat after all.<br><p>
